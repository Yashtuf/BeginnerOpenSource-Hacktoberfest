# Contribution Guidelines ðŸ“š

Welcome to our project! We appreciate your interest and contributions. Please read the following guidelines carefully to ensure a smooth collaboration.

## General Rules:

- **Creativity Allowed:** Feel free to submit pull requests that break the rulesâ€”we might just merge them anyway!
- **No Build Steps & Virtual Envs:** Avoid adding build steps like `npm install` to maintain simplicity as a static site.
- **Preserve Existing Content:** Do not remove existing content.
- **Code Style:** Your code can be neat, messy, simple, or complex. As long as it works, it's welcome.
- **Add Your Name:** Remember to add your name to the `contributorsList` file.
- **Keep it Small:** Aim for small pull requests to minimize merge conflicts and streamline reviews.

## 2. Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.


## 3. Clone Your Fork:
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

   

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```bash
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

For example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:this-is-you/first-contributions.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```bash
cd  repositoryname
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```bash
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```bash
git switch -c add-project1
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

<img align="right" width="450" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png" alt="git status" />

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```bash
git add Contributors.md
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```bash
git commit -m "Add your-name to Contributors list"
```

replacing `your-name` with your name.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```bash
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

Now submit the pull request.

## Avoiding Conflicts {Syncing Your Fork}

To keep your fork up-to-date with the main repository and avoid conflicts:

1. **Add Upstream Remote:**

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/yaswanthteja/BeginnerOpenSource-Hacktoberfest
   ```

2. **Verify the New Remote:**

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

3. **Sync Your Fork with Upstream:**

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

   This will pull in changes from the parent repository and help you resolve any conflicts.

4. **Keep Updated:**
   - Regularly pull changes from the upstream repository to keep your fork updated.

We look forward to your contributions and thank you for being a part of our community!
